# __init__, based on HTML5 Boilerplate [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/drublic/init.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/drublic/init)

This project extends [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) with some more structure for SCSS files and JavaScripts.


## TODO

* Move all files currently not affected by Grunt into `dist`-dir (#11)
* Tests (#7)


## Dependencies

You will need to install some stuff, if you haven't already:

Majors:

* Node.js
* Ruby

Secondaries:

* Node: npm
* Ruby: SASS

After you've set this stuff up please run

  $ npm install -g grunt-cli

This installs the Grunt command line tools.
Afterwards please run

  $ npm install

in your project's directory.
This will install all the things you need for running the grunt-tasks automatically.

### Troubleshooting

If running the install does not work, please try running it as with admin-rights:

  $ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli


## Contribute

Please help making this project better and [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) with your knowledge.


## CSS

We are currently working with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (in its dialect SCSS) and do not use CSS directly. Please do not edit the CSS-files in any case but search the correct `.scss` file and edit the according SCSS. If you are not familiar with SCSS you can write pure CSS which is actually valid SCSS.

However all `.scss`-files are compiled into one file called `main.css` in the `css`-folder. There is a productive-version too.

You can find more information about the installation process of SASS and the usage of SCSS in the [SASS Tutorial](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html).


## JS

We use jQuery and Modernizr (custom build via Grunt).

Please use JSHint for your JavaScript before you commit. You can use the Grunt-task `jshint` for this. It is also integrated in `grunt watch`.


## Deployment

Please use [Grunt.js](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) for building a production-state of a website. The `Gruntfile.js` has tasks for concatenating and minifing CSS and JavaScript.

Additional information on this project is stored in `package.json`.
